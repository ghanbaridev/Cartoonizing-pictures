# Cartoonizing-pictures
In this program, we are trying to cartoonize the images by using the Python language. In this project, libraries such as tkinter, cv2, and matplotlib are used in this project. First, the images are resized, then they are grayscaled, and in the next step, cartoon effects are applied.
